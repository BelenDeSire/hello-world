Hi Humans!

I'm Belen, and yes this is me trying to learn how to code for the 1254522665225656th time (hopefuly this will be it!)
I drink lots of tea and eat tons of carbs. I have no idea why that would be important for you to know now, but who knows? 
Maybe one day I'll be famous and someone will post a video about ten things they don't know about me lol
I'll wait.
Bye Humans!
